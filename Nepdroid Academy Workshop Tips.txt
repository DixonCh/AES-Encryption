Java 1.8 is compulsory and essential..

1. Oath 2 

-It is the security plugin authentication system used by facebook
google etc..

2. Encryption and Decryption Process

3. Regular Expression is used for the validation.

4. SQL Injection is certain hacking process.

5. Security should provide Solution to the SQL Injection

6. String nemeRegex="[A-Z][a,b]{4,6}"; min=4 max=6

7. When the numbers are also kept in String then process becomes fast!

8. util package ->> AWT replacement

9. API is made first.API is very important in JAVA. So try to make it!! developed by Spring founder.

10. API doesn't care for the front end. sends data in JSON format and also returns data in JSON format. 

11. Study the architecture of JSON and API..

12. Tokens are of two types

13. cache file initiates counting

14. JSON is interesting

15. Checking user's IP address can also be done.

16. UTF-8 is used for laguage independent.But there can be other languages as well.

17. BATCH concept: Runs without the authority of Windows
 
18. Encryption Algorithms: SHA,AES,ECB,PKCS5Padding

19. e.printstacktrace()

20. Set break point, right click and click on start debugging and press F6.

21. Remove break points after use.



19. Join <<"Java Nepal">> Group in facebook for the books, solutions, encryption books 

20. Error/ Exception Handling, Debugging (Process)Skills should be strong, 

21. Compile type errors:

22. Runtime Errors 

23. <<AES Algorithm>>

22. Don't set much break points... else error is generated.

23. Cipher uses AES ->ECB-> PKCS5Padding pattern and then encrypts...

24. Cipher is the encrypted file.

25. How does AES algorithm works?? Changes in AESCheck in Internet/ Google. 

26. Transaction Management deals with the handling with the errors generated by the communication issues.
	
	<Auto Commit Testing>

 When Auto Commit.commit("true")then only data is sent to the database permanently..
Until commit is true..

 

27. Accounting into Software  implementation is the most difficult and tedious task.

28. First Spring Framework then .NET is generated..

29. Study API of other programmers as far as possible(afap).

30. Study and follow the books of Oracle only (afap).

31. Oracle classes consult to the Neparoid..

32. Multiple Token passing(Multiple Login system) provides maximum security!!

33. enum {admin (1), admin (2)}

34. Auth 2 takes 5 days to complete. Consult to Neproid Academy...


33. 

31. getBytes("UTF-8") ->>> used for language independent..

32. Application Tuning is imp

33. Application for the performance testing can be used..

34. Don't use ...util.*; etc because it imports unnecessary parts and slows the performance

35. Stop learning awt, swing! >>> 

36. Now learn JavaFX!!

37. --------------------
    - Id - IP - Allow -
                  Edit
                  Delete
